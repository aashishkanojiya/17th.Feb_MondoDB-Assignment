      "source": "Answer:-MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. It stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for dynamic and flexible schema design. MongoDB is designed to handle a large volume of unstructured data and is widely used for its high performance and ease of scalability.\n\nNon-Relational Databases (NoSQL Databases)\nNon-relational databases are designed to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike SQL databases, they don’t rely on a fixed schema, making them ideal for applications where data structure may change frequently. Non-relational databases are often used in distributed systems, where they support high availability, scalability, and quick access to large volumes of diverse data.\n\nScenarios to Prefer MongoDB Over SQL Databases:\n1.Dynamic Schema Requirements\nWhen the data structure is evolving and may vary between records, MongoDB’s schema flexibility allows for adjustments without downtime.\n2.Unstructured Data:\nIf your data lacks a rigid structure or includes various formats (e.g., JSON, XML), MongoDB can handle this more efficiently than traditional SQL databases.\n3.High Volume of Data:\nMongoDB is well-suited for applications that need to process and store large amounts of data due to its high performance and ability to scale horizontally.\n4.Horizontal Scalability:\nMongoDB scales horizontally across multiple servers, which makes it ideal for handling large-scale applications where data and traffic grow significantly over time.\n5.Real-Time Analytics:\nFor use cases involving real-time analytics and data processing, MongoDB's performance characteristics can provide quick insights and results.\n6.Geospatial Data:\nMongoDB has strong support for geospatial queries, making it ideal for applications that involve location-based data and services.",

It retrieves documents that match a specified filter and returns a cursor to the result set, which can then be iterated over to access the documents. The find() method is very flexible and can be used with various query operators to filter data based on specific criteria.\n\nHere's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use the find() method:\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n#Establish connection to MongoDB\nclient = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n\n#Access the database and collection\ndb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\ncollection = db[\"customers\"]\n\n#Query to find documents where the name is \"Alice\"\nquery = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\nresults = collection.find(query)\n\n#Print the query results\nfor document in results:\n    print(document)\n\n#Query to find all documents in the collection\nall_results = collection.find()\n\n#Print all documents\nfor document in all_results:\n    print(document)\n\n1.find(filter): Retrieves documents that match the filter criteria.\n2.Iterate Over Results: Use a loop to access and print each document from the result set.\n\nThis demonstrates the basic use of the find() method to query a MongoDB collection and retrieve documents.",

You can sort the documents in either ascending or descending order based on the values of one or more fields.\n\nBasic Usage: collection.find().sort(\"field_name\", direction)\n1.field_name: The name of the field by which to sort the documents.\n2.direction: The direction of the sort, where 1 indicates ascending order and -1 indicates descending order.\n\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB using the pymongo library:\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n#Establish connection to MongoDB\nclient = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n\n#Access the database and collection\ndb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\ncollection = db[\"customers\"]\n\n#Sorting documents by name in ascending order\nsorted_asc = collection.find().sort(\"name\", 1)\nprint(\"Documents sorted by name in ascending order:\")\nfor document in sorted_asc:\n    print(document)\n\n#Sorting documents by name in descending order\nsorted_desc = collection.find().sort(\"name\", -1)\nprint(\"\\nDocuments sorted by name in descending order:\")\nfor document in sorted_desc:\n    print(document)\n\nAscending Order: Use 1 as the direction.\nDescending Order: Use -1 as the direction.\n\nThis illustrates how to sort query results in MongoDB effectively\n",
